## Origin text2

```
word trees, bear moondd dfds_dd
world like a trees, baar moondd dfds_dd
aword bbar, trees moondd dfds_dd
bword trees, moondd bcar dfds_dd
trees cord, dfds_dd bdar moondd
dord trees, rear moondd dfds_dd
```

## 变成带引号的键值对后

```
"word trees": "bear moondd dfds_dd",
"world like a trees": "baar moondd dfds_dd",
"aword bbar": "trees moondd dfds_dd",
"bword trees": "moondd bcar dfds_dd",
"trees cord": "dfds_dd bdar moondd",
"dord trees": "rear moondd dfds_dd",
```

## 变成 Python 字典后

```
mapping = {
    "word trees": "bear moondd dfds_dd",
    "world like a trees": "baar moondd dfds_dd",
    "aword bbar": "trees moondd dfds_dd",
    "bword trees": "moondd bcar dfds_dd",
    "trees cord": "dfds_dd bdar moondd",
    "dord trees": "rear moondd dfds_dd",
}
```

## 将 Python 字典的所有 Value 字符粘贴至此后

```
bear moondd dfds_dd
baar moondd dfds_dd
trees moondd dfds_dd
moondd bcar dfds_dd
dfds_dd bdar moondd
